### Welcome and [Namaste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste)!

I am a polyglot developer and have been hacking at things for almost twelve years now at the <a href="#" title="2015-01-25 14:40" onclick="return false;">time</a> of updating this page. I love building things with technology, especially, architecting scalable, highly performant, multi-tier solutions and I strive for rich user experiences in all of the applications I build.

C# and .NET has been my bread and butter for quite some time now, with increasing focus into Microsoft Azure, Windows Store apps and a little bit of cross-platform fun with Xamarin. I am excited that the projects from my mainstream job has been allowing me to work with more of iOS/Android/Web development projects these days.

Outside of my day-job, I have also been contributing to [a few Open Source projects](https://github.com/floydpink) - especially in node.js/.NET/iOS/Android/Web categories and would definitely love to keep doing more of these. Have done a fair bit of Angular.js & ember.js and using these to write powerful web and/or mobile apps (with tools like PhoneGap) is what's been keeping me busy off late.

`Swift`, the new language from Apple for iOS/Mac OS X development is definitely much more excitng and interesting than working with its kludgy predecessor - `Objective-C`. `JavaScript`, `C#`, `Java`, `Swift`, `Objective-C` are the languages that I work with and love them possibly in that order. `WebStorm` from JetBrains has been my favorite IDE for quite some time now and `Visual Studio` (along with `ReSharper` from JetBrains) is also one the best development tools I have used.

`Android Studio` from Google (built on the `IntelliJ` platform from JetBrains) is what I use for the little bit of Android development I do. I have played around a little with `AppCode` (JetBrains again) - waiting for the `Swift` support to be more mature there. `Xcode` from Apple is what I have to rely on for the iOS apps that I create - and it definitely makes you yearn for more JetBrains kinda features for refactoring, navigation etc.

### Projects

These are the few that I think are worthy of a mention here:

 - [flickr downloadr](http://flickrdownloadr.com) - A flickr download manager for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux conceived from a personal need.
 - [Bhagavad Gita](http://floydpink.github.io/BhagavadGita) - Android, iOS, Apple iBooks and web versions of [Srimad Bhagavad Gita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita) in [Malayalam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam).
 - [Cached Image](https://github.com/floydpink/CachedImage) - A WPF control that wraps the native Image control to enable file-system based caching.
 - [lzwCompress.js](http://floydpink.github.io/lzwCompress.js) - A compression utility spun off from one of the projects I worked for.
 - [Mantis CI](http://floydpink.github.io/Mantis-CI/) - Android & iOS applications (done in PhoneGap and ember.js) for Travis CI (not maintaining this anymore).

Check out my GitHub profile for all the stuff that I fork and push to.
