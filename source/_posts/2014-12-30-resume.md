I love Stack Overflow, probably because I am passionate about technology.  Photography, music, spirituality are my other passions and all of these together makes me feel I am alive. 

I try to write a little on my blog about many different things - check it out [here](http://www.harimenon.com/blog)

You could also read a little more about me at my [about.me](http://about.me/hpachuveetil) page.

Stay beautiful !

I am currently employed and not actively looking for a switch, but feel free to let me know if you have an offer that you think I cannot resist!
